Project Title:
Country States Explorer

Project Overview:
Country States Explorer is a simple application that allows users to input a country’s name and retrieve a list of states (or administrative divisions) within that country. The purpose is to provide an intuitive and lightweight tool for exploring geographical information quickly.

Key Features:
Input a country’s name to fetch its states or administrative divisions.
Display the results in a clean, user-friendly format.
Error handling for invalid or unsupported country names.
Responsive design for use on both desktop and mobile devices.
Tech Stack:
Frontend:

Framework: React.js (chosen for its component-based architecture and ease of managing state, ensuring a smooth user experience)
Backend:

Language: Python
Framework: FastAPI (preferred for its asynchronous capabilities, which improve API performance and scalability. Additionally, its modern design simplifies development and includes built-in support for documentation using OpenAPI standards.)
API Integration:

REST Countries API or a similar service
Others:

Data Storage: None (data fetched via APIs at runtime)
Deployment: Vercel for frontend, Render for backend
Why This Project:
This project is simple yet practical, providing a chance to explore web development and API integration. It’s interesting because it combines frontend and backend development with real-world data. By working on this project, you’ll develop skills in:

Using Python for backend development with FastAPI.
Fetching and handling data from APIs.
Building a responsive user interface with React.js.
Debugging and error handling in web applications.
